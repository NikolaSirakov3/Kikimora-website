          In today's digital world, cybersecurity is essential, but it has
          become a significant burden for businesses of all sizes. Companies are
          forced to navigate a complex market of disconnected tools, facing the
          constant threat of evolving attacks. Kikimora was founded with a clear
          mission: to replace this complexity with clarity. We believe that
          world-class security should be accessible, adaptable, and grow
          alongside your ambition.
